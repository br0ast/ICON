| Recognition                    | A recognition, in the context of   this ontology, is an interpretation act made by an agent (biological or   electronic being) that links works of arts to something related to their   content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Pre-iconographical recognition | A Pre-iconographical recognition   is an interpretation act that links the artwork described (and optionally the   Pure Forms composing it) to the Artistic Motifs recognized as carrier of   meaning at the first level of analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Iconographical recognition     | A Iconographical Recognition is   an interpretation act that links the artwork described (and, if available,   the Artistic Motifs recognized at the previous level along with their   compositions) to the Images recognized, or directly to the Invenzione that results   from the grouping of the subject depicted by each single image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Iconological recognition       | An Iconological Recognition is   an interpretation act that links the artwork described (and optionally all   the subjects represented at the first and second level of interpretation) to   the Intrinsic Meanings recognized. This act is equal to: (1) the third level   act of Interpretation described by Panofsky (1939), without a distinction   between a overall artwork symbolic meaning and a societal aspect, (2) the   third and fourth level described by Van Straten, according to the value   associated to the intrinsic meaning, (3) the iconic act of interpretation   described by Imdahl (2012), when the intrinsic meaning is directly linked to   level 1 characteristics of the image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Formal motif recognition       | The act of recognizing that   subjects depicted by different artworks has the same formal motifs although   the content represented may be different. The need of the usage of this class   emerged from a bottom-up approach, rather than Panofsky's theory. It describes   that certain subjects are prototypes of others, including preliminary   drawings, but also cases in which another artist copied only the composition   or gestures from another artwork. This recognition can link every specific   part of a representation to the specific prototypes. The relation is between   level 1 objects, i.e. Artistic Motifs and Composition, since it describes a   formal aspect. Example of usage: if Hercules carrying the Boar is the   prototype for a Christ carrying a deer, symbol of the human souls, it's   possible to relate directly the boar represented in the former artwork to the   deer represented in the latter. |

| Interpreter                    | The interpreter is the agent   (not necessarily human) that performs the interpretation acts through the   various types of recognitions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Work of art                    | The artwork is a visual   representation that may be relevant from an iconographical or an iconological   point of view, carried by a physical cultural object (crm:E22) usually   created by a person.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Pre-iconographical level.

## Description

Works of art can be analyzed through different levels of interpretation. In the first level, the artistic motifs recognized by the interpreter are linked to natural objects (such as a man, sword, dog, etc...), expressional qualities (such as a pose, gesture), actions (running, screaming...), and finally qualities (color, size). The artistic motif correspond to a physical part of the artwork, called Pure form. A pure form is described by its coordinates. A series of artistic motifs can be grouped together in a composition that can have a compositional structure (like linear, parallel, pyramidal). Additionally, an interpreter might recognise similarities between artistic motifs present in a work of art with other artistic motifs of another work of art, recognizing a prototypical artistic motif or composition that is reused in another artwork. Finally, pre-iconographical recognitions and formal motif recognitions can be grouped together to form the pre-iconographical description of an artwork. Different agents might recognize different elements in the same artwork, so that an artwork may have multiple pre-iconographical descriptions that can contain contrasting pre-iconographical or formal motif recognitions.

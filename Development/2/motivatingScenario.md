## Name

Iconographical Analysis.

## Description

Works of art can be analyzed through different layers of interpretation. In the second layer, the
interpreter performs an iconographical recognition. In this recognition, images recognized in works of art are linked to personifications, symbols, known characters, places, events, named object. A work of art might be associated with multiple images. A group of coherent characters, objects, symbols etc.. associated to images is called an "invenzione". Specifically, a group of personification/symbols form an Allegory. On the other hand, a group of characters, places and events are called a Story. An interpreter might recognize "invenzioni" in a work of art. A work of art might be associated to multiple stories and allegories. Characters, symbols, personifications, named objects, events, stories and allegories are work of art- independent, in the sense that they exist outside of the work of art. Their representations in works of art in the form of images are instead work-of-art dependent. The same image can't be present in multiple works of art, but the same character that refers to multiple images can. Images can be linked to the  natural motifs that represent them in a preiconographical recognition (i.e. the image associated to the character Virgin Mary can be asssociated to the artistic motif representing a woman). If that artistic motif is the main recognizing factor for an image it needs to be highlighted. The enumeration of Iconograhical Recognition performed on a paper represents the Iconographical Analysis of the work of art in question. A work of art might have different Iconographical Descriptions that come from different sources.

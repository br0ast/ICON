Iconographical Synthesis

## Description

Works of art can be analyzed through different layers of interpretation. In the third layer, the whole artwork or its artistic motifs, compositions and images are linked to underlying principles that manifest philosophical, religious, social, political tendencies, attitudes and values of a certain country, historic period or other contexts through the iconological recognition of intrinsic meanings. The recognition of an intrinstic meaning might be facilitated by a series of cultural phenomena recognized in the work of art. The enumeration of the iconological recognitions of intrinsic meanings of a work of art along with all the recognized attitudes, tendencies, values and cultural phenomena that take part in these intrinstic meanings is called Iconographical Synthesis. An iconographical synthesis might depend on a pre-iconographical description or an iconographical description of the same work of art.

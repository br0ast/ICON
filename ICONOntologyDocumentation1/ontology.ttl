Allegories are recognized in the context of iconographical recognition; their recognition can be included in an Iconographical Description. This definition of Allegory has been taken from Panofsky's Studies in Iconology (1939). Nevertheless, also a story can have a symbolical meaning. In this case, it is suggested to associate a Story to the images describing its content, an allegory  to the images describing the story and the symbolical meaning associated to it. E.g.: the fall of Phaeton was generally considered as an allegory of the fate of every temerarius (Panofsky 1939, p. 218). Therefore, the image identifying Phaeton is linked both to the Allegory and to the Story."@en ;

The need of the usage of this class emerged from a bottom-up approach, rather than Panofsky's theory. It describes that certain subjects are prototypes of others, including preliminary drawings, but also cases in which another artist copied only the composition or gestures from another artwork. This recognition can link every specific part of a representation to the specific prototypes. The relation is between level 1 objects, i.e. Artistic Motifs and Composition, since it describes a formal aspect. Example of usage: if Hercules carrying the Boar is the prototype for a Christ carrying a deer, symbol of the human souls, it's possible to relate directly the boar represented in the former artwork to the deer represented in the latter."@en ;

The recognition of an Invenzione happens in the context of the iconographical recognition and it is included in the Iconographical Description. This definition slightly differs from the Panofsky's one: while he describes an invenzione as a form expressing the subject, we consider it as an individual belonging to the \"sphere of secondary or conventional subject matter, viz., the world of specific themes or concepts manifested in images [...]\". This new definition has been introduced to allow to formalize and recognize subjects represented in different artworks.

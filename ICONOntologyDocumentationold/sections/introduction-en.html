The ICON ontology provides classes and properties to formally represent interpretations of works of art, with a focus on iconography and iconology. Therefore, the object of the interpretation is mainly the subject represented and the content of the artworks, including socio-cultural phenomena that can be expressed by it. 
The ontology creation is motivated by the need to describe thoroughly the artwork content to faithfully represent iconographical and iconological aspects, attributing subjectivity, responsibility and sources to each statement.  In this way, complex domain-specific aspects can be represented and integrated into the context of the semantic web. 

The ontology structure follows the theory described by the art historian Erwin Panofsky as expressed in <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/265570808">Studies in Iconology</a><a href="#el1">[1]</a>, who subdivided the act of interpretation into three layers, i.e. pre-iconographical, iconographical and iconological. The subject is interpreted in each layer with an increasing level of complexity. For example, a child with wings, bow and arrows (level 1) is recognized at level 2 as the character Cupid, and at the third level, a cultural meaning can be associated with its specific representation in a certain artwork, e.g. a good omen for a wedding in Lorenzo Lotto's <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/it/art/collection/search/436918">Venus and Cupid</a>.  By adopting this theory, the ontology aims at formally representing carefully the subjects represented in artworks, their variations and meanings. 

ICON is a domain-specific ontology intended to be used by 1) museums aiming at describing thoroughly the content of the artworks, 2) art historians conducting research with the aim of quantitative approaches, and 3) developers using computer vision to associate a content description to portions of artworks. 

At the current state, ICON allows expressing the subjectiveness and responsibility of the attributions for each element recognized in the artwork, along with the sources from which the claim is extracted and the evidence on which it is based. In this way, multiple statements about the same artwork can be modelled. 
The objects that are possible to be described at each level are 1) natural elements (e.g. people, objects), expressional qualities (i.e. emotions), actions, qualities (e.g. colour, pose), spatial arrangement (e.g. three people arranged in a pyramidal structure); 2) characters, specific places and objects (e.g. the city of Paris or the Bible book), personifications, symbols, allegories, stories; 3) meanings and cultural phenomena.

Instances of E81 Transformation are therefore distinct from re-classifications (documented using E17 Type Assignment) or modifications (documented using E11 Modification) of objects that do not fundamentally change their nature or identity. Characteristic cases are reconstructions and repurposing of historical buildings or ruins, fires leaving buildings in ruins, taxidermy of specimen in natural history.\nEven though such instances of E81 Transformation are often motivated by a change of intended use, substantial material changes should justify the documentation of the result as a new instance of E18 Physical Thing and not just the change of function. The latter may be documented as an extended activity (instance of E7 Activity) of using it.\n\nExamples:\n- the mummification of Tut-Ankh-Amun (E81, E12) [the mummification of the body of the deceased is a human production process and simultaneously preserves structures of the body at and before death] (Carter and Mace 1977)\n- the death, carbonization and petrification of some people of Pompeii in 79AD by the intense heat of a pyroclastic cloud and ashes from the Eruption of Mount Vesuvius (E69, E81)\n- the transformation of the Hephaisteion temple in Athens, better known as “Theseion”, into a Christian church, dedicated to Saint George <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George> around AD 700 (E81,E12) [which actually helped preserving part of the antique temple structure from 449BC]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E81(x) ?

      "undefined" : "An Allegory is a cohese combination of images that represent either symbols of personifications. Allegories are recognized in the context of iconographical recognition; their recognition can be included in an Iconographical Description. This definition of Allegory has been taken from Panofsky's Studies in Iconology (1939). Nevertheless, also a story can have a symbolical meaning. In this case, it is suggested to associate a Story to the images describing its content, an allegory  to the images describing the story and the symbolical meaning associated to it. E.g.: the fall of Phaeton was generally considered as an allegory of the fate of every temerarius (Panofsky 1939, p. 218). Therefore, the image identifying Phaeton is linked both to the Allegory and to the Story."

Typical instances of curated holdings are museum collections, archives, library holdings and digital libraries. A digital library is regarded as an instance of E18 Physical Thing because it requires keeping physical carriers of the electronic content.\nItems may be added or removed from an E78 Curated Holding in pursuit of this plan. This class should not be confused with the E39 Actor maintaining the E78 Curated Holding who is often referred to using the name of the E78 Curated Holding (e.g. “The Wallace Collection decided…”). \nCollective objects in the general sense, like a tomb full of gifts, a folder with stamps, or a set of chessmen, should be documented as instances of E19 Physical Object, and not as instances of E78 Curated Holding. This is because they form wholes, either because they are physically bound together or because they are kept together for their functionality.\n\nExamples:\n- the John Clayton Herbarium (Blake, 1918), (Natural History Museum, 2021)\n- the Wallace Collection (Ingamells, 1990)\n- Mikael Heggelund Foslie’s coralline red algae Herbarium at the Museum of Natural History and Archaeology, Trondheim, Norway (Woelkerling et al., 2005)\n- the Digital Collections of the Munich DigitiZation Center (MDZ) accessible via https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/ at least in January 2018.\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E78(x) ?

There are at least two basic directions such investigations might take. The investigation may wish to determine where something was during some time or it may wish to reconstruct the total passage of a phenomenon’s spacetime volume through an examination of discrete presences. Observation and measurement of features indicating the presence or absence of a phenomenon in some space allows for the progressive approximation of spatial extents through argumentation typically based on inclusion, exclusion and various overlaps.\n\nExamples:\n- the Roman Empire on 19(th) August AD 14 (Clare and Edwards, 1992)\n- Johann Joachim Winckelmann’s whereabouts in December 1775 (Leppmann, 1970)\n- Johann Joachim Winckelmann’s whereabouts from 19(th) November 1755 until 9(th) April 1768 (Leppmann, 1970)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E93(x) ?

It is typical of instances of E22 Human-Made Object that conform to an instance of E99 Product Type that its component parts are interchangeable with component parts of other instances of E22 Human-Made Object made after the model of the same instance of E99 Product Type. Frequently, the uniform production according to a given instance of E99 Product Type is achieved by creating individual tools, such as moulds or print plates that are themselves carriers of the design of the product type. Modern tools may use the flexibility of electronically controlled devices to achieve such uniformity. The product type itself, i.e. the potentially unlimited series of aesthetically equivalent items, may be the target of artistic design, rather than the individual object. In extreme cases, only one instance of a product type may have been produced, such as in a “print on demand” process which was only triggered once.

      "en" : "Scope note:\nThis class comprises quantifiable properties that can be measured by some calibrated means and can be approximated by values, i.e. points or regions in a mathematical or conceptual space, such as natural or real numbers, RGB values, etc.\nAn instance of E54 Dimension represents the empirical or theoretically derived quantity, including the precision tolerances resulting from the particular method or calculation. The identity of an instance of E54 Dimension depends on the method of its determination because each method may produce different values even when determining comparable qualities. For instance, the wingspan of a bird alive or dead is a different dimension. Thermoluminescence dating and Rehydroxylation [RHX] dating are different dimensions of temporal distance from now, even if they aim at dating the same object. The method of determination should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of). Note that simple terms such as “diameter” or “length” are normally insufficient to unambiguously describe a respective dimension. In contrast, “maximum linear extent” may be sufficient.\nThe properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of instances of E54 Dimension adequate to the precision of the applied method of determination. If the respective quantity belongs to a non-discrete space according to the laws of physics, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that comparability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.\nNumerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension, as appropriate.\n\nExamples:\n- the weight of the Luxor Obelisk [250 metric tons]\n- the vertical height of the statue of David by Michelangelo [5.17 metres]\n- the weight of the Great Star of Africa diamond [530.2 carats]\n- the calibrated C14 date for the Shroud of Turin [AD1262-1312, 1303-1384]\n- the horizontal diameter of the Stonehenge Sarsen Circle [33 metres] (Pryor, 2016)\n- the length of the sides of the Great Pyramid at Giza [230.34 metres] (Lehner and Hawass, 2017)\n- the duration of the time-span of the Battle of Issos/Issus on 15(th) November 333 B.C.E.

They may have a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional geometric extent, but there are no natural borders that separate them completely in an objective way from the carrier objects. For example, a doorway is a feature but the door itself, being attached by hinges, is not. \nInstances of E26 Physical Feature can be features in a narrower sense, such as scratches, holes, reliefs, surface colours, reflection zones in an opal crystal or a density change in a piece of wood. In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to state who or what is or was responsible for them. They cannot be separated from the carrier object, but a segment of the carrier object may be identified (or sometimes removed) carrying the complete feature. \nThis definition coincides with the definition of “fiat objects”, with the exception of aggregates of “bona fide objects” (Smith & Varzi, 2000).\n\nExamples:\n- the cave of Dirou, Mani, Greece (Psimenos. 2005)\n- the temple in Abu Simbel before its removal, which was carved out of solid rock (E25) (Hawass, 2000)\n- Albrecht Duerer's signature on his painting of Charles the Great (E25) (Strauss, 1974)\n- the damage to the nose of the Great Sphinx in Giza (Temple, 2009)\n- Michael Jackson’s nose prior to plastic surgery\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E26(x) ?

An instance of E15 Identifier Assignment may include the creation of the identifier from multiple constituents, which themselves may be instances of E41 Appellation. The syntax and kinds of constituents to be used may be declared in a rule constituting an instance of E29 Design or Procedure.\nExamples of such identifiers include Find Numbers, Inventory Numbers, uniform titles in the sense of librarianship and Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). Documenting the act of identifier assignment and deassignment is especially useful when objects change custody or the identification system of an organization is changed. In order to keep track of the identity of things in such cases, it is important to document by whom, when, and for what purpose an identifier is assigned to an item.\nThe fact that an identifier is a preferred one for an organisation can be expressed by using the property E1 CRM Entity. P48 has preferred identifier (is preferred identifier of): E42 Identifier. It can better be expressed in a context independent form by assigning a suitable E55 Type, such as “preferred identifier assignment”, to the respective instance of E15 Identifier Assignment through the P2 has type (is type of) property.\n\nExamples:\n- replacement of the inventory number TA959a by GE34604 for a 17(th) century lamentation cloth at the Museum Benaki, Athens\n- assigning the author and uniform title heading “Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von, 1749-1832.

The type of the property asserted to hold between two items or concepts can be described by the property P177 assigned property of type (is type of property assigned): E55 Type. \nFor example, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain scientific/scholarly procedures, e.g. the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on whether this information should be accessible by structured queries.\nThis class allows for the documentation of how the respective assignment came about, and whose opinion it was. Note that all instances of properties described in a knowledge base are the opinion of someone. Per default, they are the opinion of the team maintaining the knowledge base. This fact must not individually be registered for all instances of properties provided by the maintaining team, because it would result in an endless recursion of whose opinion was the description of an opinion. Therefore, the use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment marks the fact that the maintaining team is in general neutral to the validity of the respective assertion, but registers someone else’s opinion and how it came about.\nAll properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly relating the respective pair of items or concepts. Multiple use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment may possibly lead to a collection of contradictory values.\n\nExamples:\n- the examination of MS Sinai Greek 418 by Nicholas Pickwoad in November 2003 (Honey & Pickwoad, 2010)\n- the assessment of the current ownership of Martin Doerr’s silver cup in February 1997 (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E13(x) ?

They may serve describing the physical location of things or phenomena or other areas of interest. Geometrically, instances of E53 Place constitute single contiguous areas or a finite aggregation of disjoint areas in space which are each individually contiguous. They may have fuzzy boundaries.\nThe instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of “immobile” objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks, but may also be determined by reference to mobile objects. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame.\nIt is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, people are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object, i.e. H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.\nAny instance of E18 Physical Thing can serve as a frame of reference for an instance of E53 Place. This may be documented using the property P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for).\n\nExamples:\n- the extent of the UK in the year 2003\n- the position of the hallmark on the inside of my wedding ring (fictitious)\n- the place referred to in the phrase: “Fish collected at three miles north of the confluence of the Arve and the Rhone”\n- here -> <- [the place between these two arrows in one of the reader's paper copy of this document.

      "en" : "Scope note:\nThis class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.\nIt is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an instance of E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the “ground” or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.\nOften, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore, E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical birth, an instance of E67 Birth, can be seen as both a single event, i.e. an instance of E5 Event, and as an extended period, i.e. an instance of E4 Period, that consists of multiple physical processes and complementary activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.\nE4 Period is a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime Volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CIDOC CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel, 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance, it is possible to discuss the physical extent of an instance of E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomenon while an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore, this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\nTypical use of this class in cultural heritage documentation is for documenting cultural and artistic periods. There are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period in the European sphere of influence lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.\nA geopolitical unit as a specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena related to the claim of power, the consequences of belonging to a jurisdictional area and an administrative system that establishes a geopolitical unit. Examples from the modern period are countries or administrative areas of countries such as districts whose actions and structures define activities and phenomena in the area that they intend to govern. The borders of geopolitical units are often defined in contracts or treaties although they may deviate from the actual practice. The spatiotemporal properties of Geopolitical units can be modelled through the properties inherited from E92 Spacetime Volume.\nAnother specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the actual extent of the set of activities and phenomena as evidenced by their physical traces that define a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.\n\nExamples:\n- Jurassic (Hallam, 1975)\n- Populated Period of Nineveh\n- Imperial Rome under Marcus Aurelius\n- European Bronze Age (Harrison, 2004) \n- Italian Renaissance (Macdonald, 1992)\n- Thirty Years War (Lee, 1991)\n- Sturm und Drang (Berkoff, 2013)\n- Cubism (Cox, 2000)\n- The Capital of Russia (E4) [the capital of Russia in the sense of an administrative unit moved in historical times from Moscow to St Petersburg and then back to Moscow. This exemplifies an administrative unit changing place over time without temporal discontinuity]\n- The settling activity of the community of Helsinki (a.k.a. Helsingfors) (E7) [the original settlement called Helsinki was located in the area of the modern airport. The community moved later to settle on the coast. This exemplifies a continued activity changing place over time without temporal discontinuity]\n- Bronze Age (E4) [Bronze Age, in the sense of technological adoption, spread over disjoint areas including islands such as the British Isles without temporal discontinuity]\n- Japan, the state (E4) [In 2021, the Japanese state as a political unit comprised in 6852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E4(x) ? E2(x)\n- E4(x) ? E92(x)\n"

They do not convey any meaning other than a positioning on the “time-line” of chronology. The actual extent of an instance of E52 Time-Span can be approximated by properties of E52 Time-Span giving inner and outer bounds in the form of dates (instances of E61 Time Primitive). Comparing knowledge about time-spans is fundamental for chronological reasoning.\nSome instances of E52 Time-Span may be defined as the actual, in principle observable, temporal extent of instances of E2 Temporal Entity via the property P4 has time-span (is time-span of): E52 Time-Span. They constitute phenomenal time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel 2013). Since our knowledge of history is imperfect and physical phenomena are fuzzy in nature, the extent of phenomenal time-spans can only be described in approximation. An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an instance of E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. It may, nevertheless, be associated with other descriptions by which people can infer knowledge about it, such as in relative chronologies.\nSome instances of E52 may be defined precisely as representing a declaration of a temporal extent, as, for instance, done in a business contract. They constitute declarative time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel 2013) and can be described via the property E61 Time Primitive P170 defines time (time is defined by): E52 Time-Span. \nWhen used as a common E52 Time-Span for two events, it will nevertheless describe them as being simultaneous, even if nothing else is known.\n\nExamples:\n- 1961\n- From 12-17-1993 to 12-8-1996\n- 14h30 to 16h22 4(th) July 1945\n- 9.30 am 1.1.1999 to 2.00 pm 1.1.1999\n- the time-span of the Ming Dynasty (Chan, 2011)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E52(x) ? E1(x)\n"

      "undefined" : "Any physical, social, or mental process, event, or state.\n\nMore theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement, etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical participants' (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.).\nHere no special direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views at a same time.\nIf a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.\n\n(1) Alternative aspectual views\n\nConsider a same event 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one). \nIn the erosion case, we could therefore have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality).\n\nThe different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox? \nA typical solution e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18 axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the modeller's attitude.\nAn alternative solution is suggested here, and exploits the notion of (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity. \nFor example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which acts as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different Description, which acts as a 'theory of state transitions'.\nConsider that in no case the actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view.\n\n(2) Alternative intentionality views\n\nSimilarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those natural forces.\nAlso in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description is taken for interpreting the Event. \nOn the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because we are adding a part to it. \nTherefore, if intentionality is a criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity.\n\n(3) Alternative participant views\n\nA slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on them. \nFor example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the identity of an avalanche change.\nAnyway, this approach to event classification is based on the designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see. e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb synsets).\n\nUltimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever 'true reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it. \nBoth positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which assist domain experts in representing a certain portion of reality according to their own assumptions and requirements. \n\nFor this reason, in this ontology version of DOLCE, both events and situations are allowed, together with descriptions (the reason for the inclusion of the D&S framewrok in DOLCE), in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position (if any) chosen by the model designer."

      "en" : "Scope note:\nThis class comprises items that have persistent characteristics of structural nature substantially related to their identity and their integrity, sometimes known as “endurants” in philosophy. Persistent Items may be physical entities, such as people, animals or things, conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or even names. \nInstances of E77 Persistent Item may be present or be part of interactions in different periods or events. They can repeatedly be recognized at disparate occasions during their existence by characteristics of structural nature. The respective characteristics need not be exactly the same during all the existence of an instance of E77 Persistent Item. Often, they undergo gradual change, still bearing some similarities with that of previous times, or disappear completely and new emerge. For instance, a person, from the time of being born on, will gradually change all its features and acquire new ones, such as a scar. Even the DNA in different body cells will develop defects and mutations. Nevertheless, relevant characteristics used should be sufficiently similar to recognize the instance for some substantial period of time. \nThe more specific criteria that determine the identity of instances of subclasses of E77 Persistent Item may vary considerably and are described or referred to in the respective scope notes. The decision about which exact criteria to use depends on whether the observable behaviour of the respective part of reality such confined conforms to the reasoning the user is interested in. For example, a building can be regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria, such as being bodily separated from other persons. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. On the opposite, the identity of a (version of a) text of a scientific publication is given by the exact arrangement of its relevant symbols. \nThe main classes of objects that fall outside the scope of the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties. \nAn instance of E77 Persistent Item does not require actual knowledge of the identifying features of the instance being currently known. There may be cases, where the actual identifying features of an instance of E77 Persistent Item are not decidable at a particular state of knowledge.\n\nExamples:\n- Leonardo da Vinci (E21) (Strano, 1953)\n- Stonehenge (E24) (Pryor, 2016)\n- the hole in the ozone layer (E4) (Hufford and Horwitz, 2005)\n- the First Law of Thermodynamics (E89) (Craig and Gislason, 2002)\n- the Bermuda Triangle (E53) (Dolan, 2005)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E77(x) ? E1(x)\n"

It is a N-ary relationship class linking the physical unique representation depicted in an artwork to the corresponding real world meaning recognized. Each artistic motif describes exactly one meaning among: Natural Element, Action, Expression Quality. Qualities (e.g. colors) can be expressed.\nThe N-ary structure allow first of all to maintain the distinction between the particular representation belonging to the artwork considered and the general meaning of which the representation is an expression. Furthermore, it allows to carefully describe in detail what is represented in the visual representation, since it gives the chance to identify uniquely details of objects and iconographies."

A given instance of E41 Appellation can have alternative forms, i.e. other instances of E41 Appellation that are regarded as equivalent, regardless of the thing it denotes.\nDifferent languages may use different appellations for the same thing, such as the names of major cities. Some appellations may be formulated using a valid noun phrase of a particular language. In these cases, the respective instances of E41 Appellation should also be declared as instances of E33 Linguistic Object. Then the language using the appellation can be declared with the property P72 has language: E56 Language.\nInstances of E41 Appellation may be used to identify any instance of E1 CRM Entity and sometimes are characteristic for instances of more specific subclasses of E1 CRM Entity, such as for instances of E52 Time-Span (for instance “dates”), E39 Actor, E53 Place or E28 Conceptual Object. Postal addresses and E-mail addresses are characteristic examples of identifiers used by services transporting things between clients.\nEven numerically expressed identifiers for extents in space or time are also regarded as instances of E41 Appellation, such as Gregorian dates or spatial coordinates, even though they allow for determining some time or location by a known procedure starting from a reference point and by virtue of that fact play a double role as instances of E59 Primitive Value.\nE41 Appellation should not be confused with the act of naming something.

The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered “new” if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered “new” because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one. \nThis entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event. \nAn event should also be documented using an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities and matter is preserved, but identity is not.\n\nExamples:\n- the construction of the SS Great Britain (Gregor, 1971)\n- the first casting of the Little Mermaid from the harbour of Copenhagen (Dewey, 2003)\n- Rembrandt’s creating of the seventh state of his etching “Woman sitting half dressed beside a stove”, 1658, identified by Bartsch Number 197 (E12, E65, E81) (Hind, 1923)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E12(x) ?

In such cases, it may happen that the group never had more than one member. A joint pseudonym (i.e. a name that seems indicative of an individual but that is actually used as a persona by two or more people) is a particular case of E74 Group.\nA gathering of people becomes an instance of E74 Group when it exhibits organizational characteristics usually typified by a set of ideas or beliefs held in common, or actions performed together. These might be communication, creating some common artifact, a common purpose such as study, worship, business, sports, etc. Nationality can be modelled as membership in an instance of E74 Group. Married couples and other concepts of family are regarded as particular examples of E74 Group.\n\nExamples:\n- the Impressionists (Wilson, 1994)\n- the Navajo (Correll, 1972)\n- the Greeks (Williams, 1993)\n- the peace protestors in New York City on 15(th) February 2003\n- Exxon-Mobil (Raymond, 2006)\n- King Solomon and his wives (Thieberger, 1947)\n- the President of the Swiss Confederation\n- Nicolas Bourbaki [the collective pseudonym of a group of mathematicians, predominantly French alumni of the École normale supérieure] (Aczel, 2007)\n- Betty Crocker (Crocker, 2012)\n- Ellery Queen [Ellery Queen is a pseudonym created in 1929 by American crime fiction writers Frederic Dannay and Manfred Bennington Lee.] (Wheat, 2005)\n- Greenpeace\n- Paveprime Ltd\n- the National Museum of Denmark\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E74(x) ?

Typically, any such activity will leave at least forensic traces of evidence on the object.\nIf the instance of E29 Design or Procedure utilized for the modification prescribes the use of specific materials, they should be documented using property P68 foresees use of (use foreseen by): E57 Material of E29 Design or Procedure, rather than via P126 employed (was employed in): E57 Material.\n\nExamples:\n- the construction of the SS Great Britain (E12) (Gregor, 1971)\n- the impregnation of the Vasa warship in Stockholm for preservation after 1956 (Håfors, 2010)\n- the transformation of the Enola Gay into a museum exhibit by the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC between 1993 and 1995 (E12, E81) (Yakel, 2000)\n- the last renewal of the gold coating of the Toshogu shrine in Nikko, Japan (Cali and Dougil, 2012)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E11(x) ?

      "en" : "Scope note:\nThis class comprises actions measuring physical properties and other values that can be determined by a systematic, objective procedure of direct observation of particular states of physical reality. \nAn instance of E16 Measurement may use simple counting or tools, such as yardsticks or radiation detection devices. The interest is in the method and care applied, so that the reliability of the result may be judged at a later stage, or research continued on the associated documents. The date of the event is important for dimensions, which may change value over time, such as the length of an object subject to shrinkage. Methods and devices employed should be associated with instances of E16 Measurement by properties such as P33 used specific technique: E29 Design or Procedure, P125 used object of type: E55 Type, P16 used specific object (was used for): E70 Thing, whereas basic techniques such as \"carbon-14 dating\" should be encoded using P2 has type (is type of): E55 Type. Details of methods and devices reused or reusable in other instances of E16 Measurement should be documented for these entities rather than the measurements themselves, whereas details of particular execution may be documented by free text or by instantiating adequate sub-activities, if the detail may be of interest for an overarching query.\nRegardless whether a measurement is made by an instrument or by human senses, it represents the initial transition from physical reality to information without any other documented information object in between within the reasoning chain that would represent the result of the interaction of the observer or device with reality. Therefore, determining properties of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object is regarded as an instance of E13 Attribute Assignment, which may be inferred from observing and measuring representative carriers. In the case that the carrier can be named, the property P16 used specific object (was used for) should be used to indicate the instance(s) of E18 Physical Thing that was used as the empirical basis for the attribute assignment. For instance, inferring properties of depicted items using image material, such as satellite images, is not regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement, but as a subsequent instance of E13 Attribute Assignment. Rather, only the production of the images, understood as arrays of radiation intensities, is regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement. The same reasoning holds for other sensor data.\n\nExamples:\n- measurement of the height of silver cup 232 on 31(st) August 1997 (fictitious)\n- the carbon 14 dating of the “Schoeninger Speer II” in 1996 [The carbon 14 dating of an approximately 400.000 year old complete Old Palaeolithic wooden spear found in Schoeningen, Niedersachsen, Germany, in 1995.] (Kouwenhoven, 1997)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E16(x) ?

If the instance of E80 Part Removal results in the total decomposition of the original object into pieces, such that the whole ceases to exist, the activity should instead be modelled as an instance of E81 Transformation, i.e. a simultaneous destruction and production. In cases where the part removed has no discernible identity prior to its removal but does have an identity subsequent to its removal, the activity should be modelled as both an instance of E80 Part Removal and E12 Production. This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history, and continuity of identity over time, of objects that are removed from other objects, such as precious gemstones being extracted from different items of jewellery, or cultural artifacts being deaccessioned from different museum collections over their lifespan.\n\nExamples:\n- the removal of the Porite coral specimen from the Cocos Islands by Charles Darwin in April 1836 (Natural History Museum, 2021, b)\n- the removal of the engine from my car (fictitious)\n- the disposal of object number 1976:234 from the collection (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E80(x) ?

If the matter remaining from the destruction is not documented, the event is modelled solely as an instance of E6 Destruction. \n2. An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the original. In this case, the new items have separate identities. Matter is preserved, but identity is not.\n3. When the initial identity of the changed instance of E18 Physical Thing is preserved, the event should be documented as an instance of E11 Modification.\n\nExamples:\n- the destruction of Herculaneum by volcanic eruption in 79 AD (Camardo, 2013)\n- the destruction of Nineveh (E6, E7) (River, 2016) \n- the breaking of a champagne glass yesterday by my dog (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E6(x) ?

Typical examples are meetings, births, deaths, actions of decision taking, making or inventing things, but also more complex and extended ones such as conferences, elections, building of a castle, or battles.\nWhile the continuous growth of a tree lacks the limits characteristic of an event, its germination from a seed does qualify as an event. Similarly, the blowing of the wind lacks the distinctness and limits of an event, but a hurricane, flood or earthquake would qualify as an event. Mental processes are considered as events, in cases where they are connected with the material externalization of their results; for example, the creation of a poem, a performance or a change of intention that becomes obvious from subsequent actions or declarations.\nThe effects of an instance of E5 Event may not lead to relevant permanent changes of properties or relations of the items involved in it, for example an unrecorded performance. Of course, in order to be documented, some kind of evidence for an event must exist, be it witnesses, traces or products of the event.\nWhile instances of E4 Period always require some form of coherence between its constituent phenomena, in addition, the essential constituents of instances of E5 Event should contribute to an overall effect; for example, the statements made during a meeting and the listening of the audience.\nViewed at a coarse level of detail, an instance of E5 Event may appear as if it had an ‘instantaneous’ overall effect, but any process or interaction of material nature in reality have an extent in time and space. At a fine level, instances of E5 Event may be analysed into component phenomena and phases within a space and timeframe, and as such can be seen as a period, regardless of the size of the phenomena. The reverse is not necessarily the case: not all instances of E4 Period give rise to a noteworthy overall effect and are thus not instances of E5 Event.\n\nExamples:\n- the birth of Cleopatra (E67) (Pomeroy, 1984)\n- the destruction of Herculaneum by volcanic eruption in 79 AD (E6) (Camardo, 2013)\n- World War II (E7) (Barber, 1994)\n- the Battle of Stalingrad (E7) (Hoyt, 1993)\n- the Yalta Conference (E7) (Harbutt, 2010)\n- my birthday celebration 28-6-1995 (E7)\n- the falling of a tile from my roof last Sunday (fictitious)\n- the CIDOC conference 2003 (E7)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E5(x) ?

Intersections of instances of E92 Spacetime Volume, E53 Place, and E52 Time-Span are also regarded as instances of E92 Spacetime Volume. An instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is either contiguous or composed of a finite number of contiguous subsets. Its boundaries may be fuzzy due to the properties of the phenomena it derives from or due to the limited precision up to which defining expression can be identified with a real extent in spacetime. The duration of existence of an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is its projection on time.\n\nExamples:\n- the extent in space and time of the Event of Caesar’s murder (Irwin, 1935)\n- where and when the carbon 14 dating of the “Schoeninger Speer II” in 1996 took place (Kouwenhoven, 1997)\n- the spatio-temporal trajectory of the H.M.S.

For example, scientific granularities (e.g. body-organ-tissue-cell) or ontological 'strata' (e.g. social-mental-biological-physical) are  typical layerings. \nIntuitively, a constituent is a part belonging to a lower layer. Since layering is actually a partition of the world described by the ontology, constituents are not properly classified as parts, although this kinship can be intuitive for common sense.\nA desirable advantage of this distinction is that we are able to talk e.g. of physical constituents of non-physical objects (e.g. systems), while this is not possible in terms of parts.\nExample of are the persons constituting a social system, the molecules constituting a person, the atoms constituting a river, etc. \nIn all these examples, we notice a typical discontinuity between the constituted and the constituent object: e.g. a social system is conceptualized at a different layer from the persons that constitute it, a person is conceptualized at a different layer from the molecules that constitute them, and a river is conceptualized at a different layer from the atoms that constitute it."

Of course, in this way we cannot prevent symmetric usages of hasPart;\n2) dropping the reflexivity axiom, and enforce asymmetry: in this case, we would prevent all symmetric usages, but we loose the possibility of enforcing reflexivity, which is commonsensical in parthood.\nIn DUL, we adopt pattern #1 for partOf, and pattern #2 for properPartOf, which seems a good approximation: due to the lack of inheritance of property characteristics, each asymmetric hasPropertPart assertion would also be a reflexive hasPart assertion (reflexive reduction design pattern).\n\nSubproperties and restrictions can be used to specialize hasPart for objects, events, etc."

Since layering is actually a partition of the world described by the ontology, constituents are not properly classified as parts, although this kinship can be intuitive for common sense.\nA desirable advantage of this distinction is that we are able to talk e.g. of physical constituents of non-physical objects (e.g. systems), while this is not possible in terms of parts.\nExample of are the persons constituting a social system, the molecules constituting a person, the atoms constituting a river, etc. \nIn all these examples, we notice a typical discontinuity between the constituted and the constituent object: e.g. a social system is conceptualized at a different layer from the persons that constitute it, a person is conceptualized at a different layer from the molecules that constitute them, and a river is conceptualized at a different layer from the atoms that constitute it."

P7 took place at (witnessed) does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (frequently on the surface of the earth). For example, the period “Révolution française” can be said to have taken place in “France in 1789”; the “Victorian” period may be said to have taken place in “Britain from 1837-1901” and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and North America. An instance of E4 Period can take place at multiple non-contiguous, non-overlapping locations.\nAny place where something happened includes the spatial projection of the happening given in the same geometric reference system. For instance, HMS Victory, as place of Lord Nelson's dying, includes the location of his body relative to the hull of HMS Victory at his time of death as the most precise location of his death. By the definition of P161 has spatial projection, an instance of E4 Period takes place on all its spatial projections to respective reference systems, that is, instances of E53 Place. Therefore, this property implies the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within to E53 Place, where both places are defined in the same geometric reference system. The relation between an instance of E53 Place and its reference system can conveniently be documented via the property P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for).\nSomething that has happened at a given place can also be considered to have happened at a smaller place within it: for example, it is reasonable to say Caesar’s murder took place in Rome, but also on the Forum Romanum, and more precisely in the Curia. It is characteristic for different historical sources to use varying precision in such statements, without being in contradiction with each other. This may be due to lack of knowledge or to the relevance of the precision for the purpose of the statement. In information integration, the more precise statement improves the overall knowledge.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The period “Révolution française” (E4) took place at the area covered by France in 1789 (E53).

Thus, it can be seen that the projection is not unique.\nThe spatial projection is the actual spatial coverage of a spacetime volume, which normally has fuzzy boundaries except for instances of E92 Spacetime Volume which are geometrically defined in the same reference system as the range of this property and are an exception to this and do not have fuzzy boundaries. Modelling explicitly fuzzy spatial projections serves therefore as a common topological reference of different spatial approximations rather than absolute geometric determination, for instance for relating outer or inner spatial boundaries for the respective spacetime volumes.\nThe spatial projection is unique with respect to the reference system. For instance, there is exactly one spatial projection of Lord Nelson’s dying relative to the ship HMS Victory, i.e. the location of his body relative to the ship HMS Victory at the time of his death.\nIn case the domain of an instance of P161 has spatial projection is an instance of E4 Period, the spatial projection describes all areas that period was ever present at, for instance, the Roman Empire. \nThis property is part of the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place, which in turn is implied by P156 occupies (is occupied by).\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The Roman Empire (E4) has spatial projection all areas ever claimed by Rome (E53).

This real spatiotemporal extent of the instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded as being unique, in all its details and fuzziness; the identity and existence of the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume depend uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing, whose existence defines it. It constitutes a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel, 2013).\nIncluded in this spacetime volume are both the spaces filled by the matter of the physical thing and any inner space that may exist, for instance the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a finite number of individually contiguous subsets of this spacetime volume equal to the number of objects that constitute the set and that are never connected during its existence.\n\nExamples:\n- H.M.S. Temeraire (E22) defines the spacetime volume of H.M.S. Temeraire (E92). [it was built, during 1798, in Chatham and destroyed, during 1838, in Rotherhithe] (Willis, 2010)\n- The Saint Titus reliquary (E22) defines the spacetime volume of the Saint Titus reliquary (E92). [the reliquary has been produced by the workshop of the Vogiatzis brothers located at Monastiraki, Athens, in 1966 as container for the skull of Saint Titus, which was placed into it at that time and has since then continued to fall within the container’s spacetime volume. The reliquary with the skull has been kept in the Saint Titus Church in Heraklion, Crete since 1966] (Fisher & Garvey, 2010; Panotis, 2016)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- P196(x,y) ?

Since layering is actually a partition of the world described by the ontology, constituents are not properly classified as parts, although this kinship can be intuitive for common sense.\nA desirable advantage of this distinction is that we are able to talk e.g. of physical constituents of non-physical objects (e.g. systems), while this is not possible in terms of parts.\nExample of are the persons constituting a social system, the molecules constituting a person, the atoms constituting a river, etc. \nIn all these examples, we notice a typical discontinuity between the constituted and the constituent object: e.g. a social system is conceptualized at a different layer from the persons that constitute it, a person is conceptualized at a different layer from the molecules that constitute them, and a river is conceptualized at a different layer from the atoms that constitute it."

P7 took place at (witnessed) does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (frequently on the surface of the earth). For example, the period “Révolution française” can be said to have taken place in “France in 1789”; the “Victorian” period may be said to have taken place in “Britain from 1837-1901” and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and North America. An instance of E4 Period can take place at multiple non-contiguous, non-overlapping locations.\nAny place where something happened includes the spatial projection of the happening given in the same geometric reference system. For instance, HMS Victory, as place of Lord Nelson's dying, includes the location of his body relative to the hull of HMS Victory at his time of death as the most precise location of his death. By the definition of P161 has spatial projection, an instance of E4 Period takes place on all its spatial projections to respective reference systems, that is, instances of E53 Place. Therefore, this property implies the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within to E53 Place, where both places are defined in the same geometric reference system. The relation between an instance of E53 Place and its reference system can conveniently be documented via the property P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for).\nSomething that has happened at a given place can also be considered to have happened at a smaller place within it: for example, it is reasonable to say Caesar’s murder took place in Rome, but also on the Forum Romanum, and more precisely in the Curia. It is characteristic for different historical sources to use varying precision in such statements, without being in contradiction with each other. This may be due to lack of knowledge or to the relevance of the precision for the purpose of the statement. In information integration, the more precise statement improves the overall knowledge.\n\nExamples:\n- The period “Révolution française” (E4) took place at the area covered by France in 1789 (E53).

Thus, it can be seen that the projection is not unique.\nThe spatial projection is the actual spatial coverage of a spacetime volume, which normally has fuzzy boundaries except for instances of E92 Spacetime Volume which are geometrically defined in the same reference system as the range of this property and are an exception to this and do not have fuzzy boundaries. Modelling explicitly fuzzy spatial projections serves therefore as a common topological reference of different spatial approximations rather than absolute geometric determination, for instance for relating outer or inner spatial boundaries for the respective spacetime volumes.\nThe spatial projection is unique with respect to the reference system. For instance, there is exactly one spatial projection of Lord Nelson’s dying relative to the ship HMS Victory, i.e. the location of his body relative to the ship HMS Victory at the time of his death.\nIn case the domain of an instance of P161 has spatial projection is an instance of E4 Period, the spatial projection describes all areas that period was ever present at, for instance, the Roman Empire. \nThis property is part of the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place, which in turn is implied by P156 occupies (is occupied by).\n\nExamples:\n- The Roman Empire (E4) has spatial projection all areas ever claimed by Rome (E53).

For example, scientific granularities (e.g. body-organ-tissue-cell) or ontological 'strata' (e.g. social-mental-biological-physical) are  typical layerings. \nIntuitively, a constituent is a part belonging to a lower layer. Since layering is actually a partition of the world described by the ontology, constituents are not properly classified as parts, although this kinship can be intuitive for common sense.\nA desirable advantage of this distinction is that we are able to talk e.g. of physical constituents of non-physical objects (e.g. systems), while this is not possible in terms of parts.\nExample of are the persons constituting a social system, the molecules constituting a person, the atoms constituting a river, etc. \nIn all these examples, we notice a typical discontinuity between the constituted and the constituent object: e.g. a social system is conceptualized at a different layer from the persons that constitute it, a person is conceptualized at a different layer from the molecules that constitute them, and a river is conceptualized at a different layer from the atoms that constitute it."

This allows for describing the thing itself as a place that may contain other things, such as a box that may contain coins. In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence. The reference space for the associated place must be the one that is permanently at rest (P157 is at rest relative to) relative to the physical thing. For instances of E19 Physical Objects it is the one which is at rest relative to the object itself, i.e., which moves together with the object. For instances of E26 Physical Feature it is one which is at rest relative to the physical feature itself and the surrounding matter immediately connected to it. Therefore, there is a 1:1 relation between the instance E18 Physical Thing and the instance of E53 Place it occupies. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces. \nThis property implies the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place. However, in contrast to P156 occupies, the property P161 has spatial projection does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place. \nIn contrast to P156 occupies, for the property P53 has former or current location the following holds: \nIt does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place. \nIt identifies a possibly wider instance of E53 Place at which a thing is or has been for some unspecified time-span. \nIf the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place is not at rest with respect to the physical thing found there, the physical thing may move away after some time to another place and/or may have been at some other place before. The same holds for the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The Saint Titus reliquary (E22) occupies the space of the Saint Titus reliquary (E53). [The reliquary is currently kept in the Saint Titus Church in Heraklion, Crete since 1966 and contains the skull of Saint Titus.] (Fisher & Garvey, 2010)\n- Burg Eltz near Koblenz, Germany (E24) occupies the space within the 1661AD outer walls of Burg Eltz (E53). [The castle (English name: Eltz Castle) underwent a series of expansions starting in the 12(th) century until it reached its current extent in 1661AD and contains buildings from various periods.]\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P156(x,y) ? E53(y)\n- P156(x,y) ? E18(x)\n- P156(x,y) ? (?z) [E18(x) ? E53(y) ? P196(x,z) ? P161(z,y) ? P157(y,x)]\n"

Since layering is actually a partition of the world described by the ontology, constituents are not properly classified as parts, although this kinship can be intuitive for common sense.\nA desirable advantage of this distinction is that we are able to talk e.g. of physical constituents of non-physical objects (e.g. systems), while this is not possible in terms of parts.\nExample of are the persons constituting a social system, the molecules constituting a person, the atoms constituting a river, etc. \nIn all these examples, we notice a typical discontinuity between the constituted and the constituent object: e.g. a social system is conceptualized at a different layer from the persons that constitute it, a person is conceptualized at a different layer from the molecules that constitute them, and a river is conceptualized at a different layer from the atoms that constitute it."

P7 took place at (witnessed) does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (frequently on the surface of the earth). For example, the period “Révolution française” can be said to have taken place in “France in 1789”; the “Victorian” period may be said to have taken place in “Britain from 1837-1901” and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and North America. An instance of E4 Period can take place at multiple non-contiguous, non-overlapping locations.\nAny place where something happened includes the spatial projection of the happening given in the same geometric reference system. For instance, HMS Victory, as place of Lord Nelson's dying, includes the location of his body relative to the hull of HMS Victory at his time of death as the most precise location of his death. By the definition of P161 has spatial projection, an instance of E4 Period takes place on all its spatial projections to respective reference systems, that is, instances of E53 Place. Therefore, this property implies the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within to E53 Place, where both places are defined in the same geometric reference system. The relation between an instance of E53 Place and its reference system can conveniently be documented via the property P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for).\nSomething that has happened at a given place can also be considered to have happened at a smaller place within it: for example, it is reasonable to say Caesar’s murder took place in Rome, but also on the Forum Romanum, and more precisely in the Curia. It is characteristic for different historical sources to use varying precision in such statements, without being in contradiction with each other. This may be due to lack of knowledge or to the relevance of the precision for the purpose of the statement. In information integration, the more precise statement improves the overall knowledge.\n\nExamples:\n- The period “Révolution française” (E4) took place at the area covered by France in 1789 (E53). (Bertaud, 2004)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- P7(x,y) ? E4(x)\n- P7(x,y) ? E53(y)\n- P7(x,y) ? (?z,u) [P157(y,u) ? P157(z,u) ? P161(x,z) ? P89(z,y)]\n- [E4(x) ? P157(y,u) ? P157(v,u) ? P7(x,y) ?

[the original scope note was later extended in the CIDOC CRM version 4.3] \n- The people of Iraq calling the place identified by TGN ‘7017998’ (E7) used specific object “Quyunjig” (E41) mode of use current; vernacular (E55).\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P16(x,y) ?

AgeRangeForDrugUsage could parametrize data value: 14 to 50 on the datatype: xsd:int. Since complex datatypes are not allowed in OWL1.0, a solution to this can only work by creating two 'sub-parameters': MinimumAgeForDrugUsage (that hasParameterDataValue 14) and MaximumAgeForDrugUsage (that hasParameterDataValue 50), which are components of (cf. hasComponent) the main Parameter AgeRangeForDrugUsage.\nOrdering on subparameters can be created by using or specializing the object property 'precedes'."

In contrast, spatiotemporal overlaps described by P132 spatiotemporally overlaps are the total of areas simultaneously covered by the related spacetime volumes.\nThis property is symmetric. This property is reflexive.\n\nExamples:\n- The territory of the United States as in 2020 (E53) overlaps with the Arctic (E53). (Gannett et al., 1904)\n- The maximal extent of the Kingdom of Greece (1832-1973) (E53) overlaps with the maximal extent of the Republic of Turkey (29(th) October 1923 to now) (E53).\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- P121(x,y) ?

The property does not necessarily state the quality or accuracy of this approximation, but rather indicates the use of the first instance of place to approximate the second.\nIn common documentation practice, find or encounter spots e.g. in archaeology, botany or zoology are often related to the closest village, river or other named place without detailing the relation, e.g. if it is located within the village or in a certain distance of the specified place. In this case the stated “phenomenal” place found in the documentation can be seen as an approximation of the actual encounter spot without more specific knowledge. \nIn more recent documentation often point coordinate information is provided that originates from GPS measurements or georeferencing from a map. This point coordinate information does not state the actual place of the encounter spot but tries to approximate it with a “declarative” place. The accuracy depends on the methodology used when creating the coordinates. It may be dependent on technical limitations like GPS accuracy but also on the method where the GPS location is taken in relation to the measured feature. If the methodology is known a maximum deviation from the measured point can be calculated and the encounter spot or feature may be related to the resulting circle using an instance of P171 at some place within.\nThis property is not transitive.

Since Time-Spans may not have precisely known temporal extents, the CIDOC CRM supports statements about the minimum and maximum temporal extents of Time-Spans. This property allows a Time-Span’s minimum temporal extent (i.e., its inner boundary) to be assigned an E61 Time Primitive value. Time Primitives are treated by the CIDOC CRM as application or system specific date intervals, and are not further analysed. If different sources of evidence justify different minimum extents without contradicting each other, the smallest interval including all these extents will be the best estimate. This should be taken into account for information integration.\n\nExamples:\n- The time-span of the development of the CIDOC CRM (E52) ongoing throughout “1996-2003” (E61).

For example, scientific granularities (e.g. body-organ-tissue-cell) or ontological 'strata' (e.g. social-mental-biological-physical) are  typical layerings. \nIntuitively, a constituent is a part belonging to a lower layer. Since layering is actually a partition of the world described by the ontology, constituents are not properly classified as parts, although this kinship can be intuitive for common sense.\nA desirable advantage of this distinction is that we are able to talk e.g. of physical constituents of non-physical objects (e.g. systems), while this is not possible in terms of parts.\nExample of are the persons constituting a social system, the molecules constituting a person, the atoms constituting a river, etc. \nIn all these examples, we notice a typical discontinuity between the constituted and the constituent object: e.g. a social system is conceptualized at a different layer from the persons that constitute it, a person is conceptualized at a different layer from the molecules that constitute them, and a river is conceptualized at a different layer from the atoms that constitute it."

The P69.1 has type property of P69 has association with allows the nature of the association to be specified reading from domain to range; examples of types of association between instances of E29 Design or Procedure include: has part, follows, requires, etc.\nInstances of this property are considered to be symmetric, in case no directed sense is provided for them by the property P69.1 has type.\nThe property can typically be used to model the decomposition of the description of a complete workflow into a series of separate procedures.\n\nExamples:\n- The procedure for glass blowing (E29) has association with the procedure for glass heating (E29). (Brooks, 1973)\n- The set of instructions for performing Macbeth in Max Reinhardt's production in 1916 in Berlin at Deutsches Theater (E29) has association with the scene design drawing by Ernst Stern reproduced at http://www.glopad.org/pi/fr/record/digdoc/1003814 (E29) has type has part (E55).\n- The preparation of parchment (E29) has association with soaking and unhairing of skin (E29) has type has part (E55).\n- Stretching of skin (E29) has association with soaking and unhairing of skin (E29) has type follows (E55). (Poole and Reed, 1962)\n- The plan for reassembling the temples at Abu Simbel (E29) has association with the plan for storing and transporting the blocks (E29) has type follows (E55). (Loubiere, 1995)\n\nProperties:\n- P69.1 has type: E55 Type\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- P69(x,y) ? E29(x)\n- P69(x,y) ? E29(y)\n- P69(x,y,z) ? [P69(x,y) ? E55(z)]\n"

Since Time-Spans may not have precisely known temporal extents, the CIDOC CRM supports statements about the minimum and maximum temporal extents of Time-Spans. This property allows a Time-Span’s maximum temporal extent (i.e. its outer boundary) to be assigned an E61 Time Primitive value. Time Primitives are treated by the CIDOC CRM as application or system specific date intervals, and are not further analysed. If different sources of evidence justify different maximum extents without contradicting each other, the resulting intersection of all these extents will be the best estimate. This should be taken into account for information integration.\n\nExamples:\n- The time-span of the development of the CIDOC CRM (E52) at some time within “1992-infinity” (E61). (Doerr, 2003)\n- The Time-Span of the Battle in the Teutoburg Forest (E52) at some time within “September 9 CE” (E61).

The property can also be used to express similarity in cases that can be stated between two objects only, without historical knowledge about its reasons. The property expresses a symmetric relationship in case no direction of influence can be established either from evidence on the item itself or from historical knowledge. This holds in particular for siblings of a derivation process from a common source or non-causal cultural parallels, such as some weaving patterns.\nThe P130.1 kind of similarity property of the P130 shows features of (features are also found on) property enables the relationship between the domain and the range to be further clarified, in the sense from domain to range, if applicable. For example, it may be expressed if both items are product “of the same mould”, or if two texts “contain identical paragraphs”. \nIf the reason for similarity is a sort of derivation process, i.e. that the creator has used or had in mind the form of a particular thing during the creation or production, this process should be explicitly modelled. In these cases, P130 shows features of can be regarded as a shortcut of such a process. However, the current model does not contain any path specific enough to infer this property. Specializations of the CIDOC CRM may however be more explicit, for instance describing the use of moulds etc.\nThis property is not transitive. This property is irreflexive.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- Mary Lamb’s Cymbeline from Charles and Mary Lamb’s Tales from Shakespeare (E89) shows features of William Shakespeare’s Cymbeline (E89). (Carrington, 1954)\n- The audio recording of Dante Alighieri’s La divina commedia read by Enrico de Negri (E73) shows features of the text of Dante Alighieri’s La divina commedia (E89). (Alighieri, 1956)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P130(x,y) ? E70(x)\n- P130(x,y) ? E70(y) \n- P130(x,y,z) ? [P130(x,y) ? E55(z)]\n- ¬P130(x,x)\n"

The property can also be used to express similarity in cases that can be stated between two objects only, without historical knowledge about its reasons. The property expresses a symmetric relationship in case no direction of influence can be established either from evidence on the item itself or from historical knowledge. This holds in particular for siblings of a derivation process from a common source or non-causal cultural parallels, such as some weaving patterns.\nThe P130.1 kind of similarity property of the P130 shows features of (features are also found on) property enables the relationship between the domain and the range to be further clarified, in the sense from domain to range, if applicable. For example, it may be expressed if both items are product “of the same mould”, or if two texts “contain identical paragraphs”. \nIf the reason for similarity is a sort of derivation process, i.e. that the creator has used or had in mind the form of a particular thing during the creation or production, this process should be explicitly modelled. In these cases, P130 shows features of can be regarded as a shortcut of such a process. However, the current model does not contain any path specific enough to infer this property. Specializations of the CIDOC CRM may however be more explicit, for instance describing the use of moulds etc.\nThis property is not transitive. This property is irreflexive.\n\nExamples:\n- Mary Lamb’s Cymbeline from Charles and Mary Lamb’s Tales from Shakespeare (E89) shows features of William Shakespeare’s Cymbeline (E89). (Carrington, 1954)\n- The audio recording of Dante Alighieri’s La divina commedia read by Enrico de Negri (E73) shows features of the text of Dante Alighieri’s La divina commedia (E89).

It implies that the presence of the object in question was a necessary condition for the action. For example, the activity of writing this text required the use of a computer. An immaterial thing can be used if at least one of its carriers is present. For example, the software tools on a computer.\nAnother example is the use of a particular name by a particular group of people over some span to identify a thing, such as a settlement. In this case, the physical carriers of this name are at least the people understanding its use.\n\nExamples:\n- The writing of the scope note of the CIDOC CRM property “P16 used specific object” contained in the CIDOC CRM version 4.1 (E7) used specific object Nicholas Crofts’ computer (E22) mode of use Typing Tool; Storage Medium (E55). [the original scope note was later extended in the CIDOC CRM version 4.3] \n- The people of Iraq calling the place identified by TGN ‘7017998’ (E7) used specific object “Quyunjig” (E41) mode of use current; vernacular (E55).\n\nProperties:\n- P16.1 mode of use: E55 Type\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- P16(x,y) ?

The property does not necessarily state the quality or accuracy of this approximation, but rather indicates the use of the first instance of place to approximate the second.\nIn common documentation practice, find or encounter spots e.g. in archaeology, botany or zoology are often related to the closest village, river or other named place without detailing the relation, e.g. if it is located within the village or in a certain distance of the specified place. In this case the stated “phenomenal” place found in the documentation can be seen as an approximation of the actual encounter spot without more specific knowledge. \nIn more recent documentation often point coordinate information is provided that originates from GPS measurements or georeferencing from a map. This point coordinate information does not state the actual place of the encounter spot but tries to approximate it with a “declarative” place. The accuracy depends on the methodology used when creating the coordinates. It may be dependent on technical limitations like GPS accuracy but also on the method where the GPS location is taken in relation to the measured feature. If the methodology is known a maximum deviation from the measured point can be calculated and the encounter spot or feature may be related to the resulting circle using an instance of P171 at some place within.\nThis property is not transitive.

(Briquet, 1985)\n- The visual content of Jacopo Amigoni’s painting known as ‘The Singer Farinelli and friends’ (E36) incorporates the musical notation of Farinelli’s musical work entitled ‘La Partenza’ (E73). (National Gallery of Victoria)\n- The visual content of Nicolas Poussin’s painting entitled ‘Les Bergers d’Arcadie’ (E36) incorporates the Latin phrase ‘Et in Arcadia ego’ (E33).

This real spatiotemporal extent of the instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded as being unique, in all its details and fuzziness; the identity and existence of the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume depend uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing, whose existence defines it. It constitutes a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel, 2013).\nIncluded in this spacetime volume are both the spaces filled by the matter of the physical thing and any inner space that may exist, for instance the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a finite number of individually contiguous subsets of this spacetime volume equal to the number of objects that constitute the set and that are never connected during its existence.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- H.M.S. Temeraire (E22) defines the spacetime volume of H.M.S. Temeraire (E92). [it was built, during 1798, in Chatham and destroyed, during 1838, in Rotherhithe] (Willis, 2010)\n- The Saint Titus reliquary (E22) defines the spacetime volume of the Saint Titus reliquary (E92). [the reliquary has been produced by the workshop of the Vogiatzis brothers located at Monastiraki, Athens, in 1966 as container for the skull of Saint Titus, which was placed into it at that time and has since then continued to fall within the container’s spacetime volume. The reliquary with the skull has been kept in the Saint Titus Church in Heraklion, Crete since 1966] (Fisher & Garvey, 2010; Panotis, 2016)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P196(x,y) ?

(Briquet, 1985)\n- The visual content of Jacopo Amigoni’s painting known as ‘The Singer Farinelli and friends’ (E36) incorporates the musical notation of Farinelli’s musical work entitled ‘La Partenza’ (E73). (National Gallery of Victoria)\n- The visual content of Nicolas Poussin’s painting entitled ‘Les Bergers d’Arcadie’ (E36) incorporates the Latin phrase ‘Et in Arcadia ego’ (E33).

Any instance of E29 Design or Procedure may be associated with other designs or procedures. The property is considered to be symmetrical unless otherwise indicated by P69.1 has type. The property is not transitive.\nThis property is a directed relationship. The P69.1 has type property of P69 has association with allows the nature of the association to be specified reading from domain to range; examples of types of association between instances of E29 Design or Procedure include: has part, follows, requires, etc.\nInstances of this property are considered to be symmetric, in case no directed sense is provided for them by the property P69.1 has type.\nThe property can typically be used to model the decomposition of the description of a complete workflow into a series of separate procedures.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The procedure for glass blowing (E29) has association with the procedure for glass heating (E29). (Brooks, 1973)\n- The set of instructions for performing Macbeth in Max Reinhardt's production in 1916 in Berlin at Deutsches Theater (E29) has association with the scene design drawing by Ernst Stern reproduced at http://www.glopad.org/pi/fr/record/digdoc/1003814 (E29) has type has part (E55).\n- The preparation of parchment (E29) has association with soaking and unhairing of skin (E29) has type has part (E55).\n- Stretching of skin (E29) has association with soaking and unhairing of skin (E29) has type follows (E55). (Poole and Reed, 1962)\n- The plan for reassembling the temples at Abu Simbel (E29) has association with the plan for storing and transporting the blocks (E29) has type follows (E55).

This allows for describing the thing itself as a place that may contain other things, such as a box that may contain coins. In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence. The reference space for the associated place must be the one that is permanently at rest (P157 is at rest relative to) relative to the physical thing. For instances of E19 Physical Objects it is the one which is at rest relative to the object itself, i.e., which moves together with the object. For instances of E26 Physical Feature it is one which is at rest relative to the physical feature itself and the surrounding matter immediately connected to it.

However, in contrast to P156 occupies, the property P161 has spatial projection does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place. \nIn contrast to P156 occupies, for the property P53 has former or current location the following holds: \nIt does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place. \nIt identifies a possibly wider instance of E53 Place at which a thing is or has been for some unspecified time-span. \nIf the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place is not at rest with respect to the physical thing found there, the physical thing may move away after some time to another place and/or may have been at some other place before. The same holds for the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place.\n\nExamples:\n- The Saint Titus reliquary (E22) occupies the space of the Saint Titus reliquary (E53). [The reliquary is currently kept in the Saint Titus Church in Heraklion, Crete since 1966 and contains the skull of Saint Titus.] (Fisher & Garvey, 2010)\n- Burg Eltz near Koblenz, Germany (E24) occupies the space within the 1661AD outer walls of Burg Eltz (E53).

B(end )is true. \nThis property is part of the set of temporal primitives P173 – P176, P182 – P185.\nThis property corresponds to a disjunction (logical OR) of the following Allen temporal relations (Allen, 1983): {before, meets, overlaps, finished by, start, equals, during, finishes}.\nThis property is irreflexive\n\n\nhttps://cidoc-crm.org/html/version_images/images_7.1.3/image_13.png\n\n\nFigure 20: Temporal entity A ends before or with the end of temporal entity B. Here A is longer than B\n\n\nhttps://cidoc-crm.org/html/version_images/images_7.1.3/image_14.png\n\n\nFigure 21: Temporal entity A ends before or with the end of temporal entity B. Here A is shorter than B\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The reign/life of Harold II (E4) ends before or with the end of the Battle of Hastings (E7)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P184(x,y) ? E2(x)\n- P184(x,y) ? E2(y)\n- P184(x,y) ? P174(x,y)\n- ¬P184(x,x)\n"
